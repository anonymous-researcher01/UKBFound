# Label Instructions

Depending on your RAM size, you might need to cache your files first. To do this, use `cachefile.ipynb`  to save the CSV file in smaller files, each containing one column and named according to the column name.

Use `primary_care.ipynb` to process your primary care data , this will create a cache file for later use.

Similarly, use `firstocc.ipynb` to process your first occurance data.


Finally, `normaltime.ipynb` and `imgtime.ipynb` will create labels with different timeline.
